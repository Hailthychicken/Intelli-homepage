# Pixelay Notes

## Observed Differences

- **Navbar:** Navbar looks very different on pixelay, looks better on actual web page
- **Fonts:** Some headings are slightly smaller than the Figma design.
- **Spacing:** Margins and padding between sections/cards are a bit different, especially on mobile.
- **Assets:** A few icons/images are not identical to the Figma version (optimized for web).

*Overall, the layout is consistent with the Figma design, with minor visual differences (mainly the navbar and some icons).*
